# CanDB
A lightweight database for cataloging canned goods

## Dependancies

Bash -ge V4

gnucoreutils


## How to use:
>Linux

Just load ./candb.sh.

>Freebsd/Macos

Not currently supported.  I will be setting up my porting tool at some point for it.
>Windows

Requires Cygwin.  Performance is acceptable.

## Why?
Why not?  I do everything else this way so why not a database?
